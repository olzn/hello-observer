I have too much stuff. Maybe not an exhorbitant amount, maybe more, maybe even less than you do. But that's really beside the point. I have enough stuff to make me feel uneasy, and that's what matters. Accumulated possessions I thought I needed – or maybe not _needed_, but definitely desired – piled up over time. And I had the means to get them, so, well, why not? It happens to all of us. Me, I fell into the classic trap: moved to a bigger place, then suddenly found myself with more space than I knew what to do with. So obviously I filled that up with stuff, because, well, that's what you do. Nobody wants to live in empty rooms.

The space also enabled the bad habit of mine of getting myself in too many hobbies. Hobbies often require stuff, so I bought said stuff. Granted these are things I have put to use, so it's not like they're just gathering dust. Still, the point remains – were they necessary? Did I _need_ them? Of course not. You might argue that these things brought me joy, and therefore were worthwhile purchases, but that's a dangerous way of thinking about posessions. A topic for another time.

There's a story being told all around us, told through subliminal and not-so-subliminal channels, without us realising the plot, even though we do. The story is the one of finding happiness in our modern society. We all know it: get a job, work hard and climb up the ladder. Each promotion gets you a better salary, and with it, more opportunity to buy yourself more of the stuff you've always wanted. Rinse and repeat. You're right on your way to a happy life.

We're lulled into it, without realising the cyclical nature of this vicious thought-process. Or maybe we do, but we ignore it, even though it's right there in front of us. Clear as day.

The relentless machinery of advertisement spins its gears, works its magic and before we know it, we've found ourselves entombed beneath a mountain of absurd gadgetry, debt and a mortgage. What the fuck happened? Ensnared by our own making. Emprisoned, even though we never wanted it. To willingly sacrifice one's own freedom... surely nobody in their right mind would do such thing. Yet we do.

It's a palpable sensation, this one of feeling trapped. And a cause of great anxiety, even for those perceptive enough to identify its roots. Especially because there is more anxiety waiting behind the thoughts of devicing a way to escape. But freedom comes at a cost.

In order to break down the shackles, we must first have a good look and understand what these shackles are made of. Where _is_ the anxiety coming from, exactly? And how much of this is real versus a matter of perception? Not only that, but if we are to be free, we must define what this even means for us, in the first place.

But I ain't here to give you any answers. You must find those yourself. That's part of the process. No one will come to our rescue. I certainly won't.

I'll give you a clue, though, a starting point: there's safety in numbers, and a sense of comfort that arises from participating in the lifestyle your peers and everyone else around you takes part in. But the wisdom of the crowds will only get you so far. Make no mistake: comfort is the enemy. Beware of it, as it leads nowhere but dead ends in this maze we're trying to escape from.

If freedom means motion, comfort means paralysis. If freedom means progress, comfort means stagnation.

Seek things which return reward through struggle. Start slow but start now. Don't know how? Take the stairs instead of the lift. Try and fix something yourself instead of calling someone to fix it for you. Cook yourself that meal over getting take out. These may be minor things, but it's the mentality that permeates what matters. Slowly you'll start to build resilience over comfort.

So start doing the things you don't want to do, but know you should.  In other words: get your shit together, homie.
