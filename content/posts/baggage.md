I have too much stuff. Maybe not an exhorbitant amount. Maybe more, maybe even less than you do. But that's really beside the point. I have enough stuff to make me feel uneasy, and that's what matters. Accumulated possessions I thought I needed – or maybe not _needed_, but definitely desired – piled up over time. And I had the means to get them, so, well, why not? It happens to all of us. Me, I fell into the classic trap: moved to a bigger place, then suddenly found myself with more space than I knew what to do with. So obviously I filled that up with stuff, because, well, that's what you do. Nobody wants to live in empty rooms.

The space also enabled the bad habit of mine of getting myself in too many hobbies. Hobbies often require stuff, so I bought said stuff. Granted these are things I have put to use, so it's not like they're just gathering dust. Still, the point remains – were they necessary? Did I _need_ them? Of course not. You might argue that these things brought me joy, and therefore were worthwhile purchases, but that's a dangerous way of thinking about posessions. A topic for another time.

There's a story being told all around us, told through subliminal and not-so-subliminal channels, without us realising the plot, even though we do. The story is the one of finding happiness in our modern society. We all know it: get a job, work hard and climb up the ladder. Each promotion gets you a better salary, and with it, more opportunity to buy yourself more and more of the stuff you've always wanted. Rinse and repeat. You're on your way to a happy life.

We're lulled into it, without realising the cyclical nature of this vicious thought-process. Or maybe we do, but we ignore it, even though it's right there in front of us. Clear as day.

The relentless machinery of advertisement spins its gears, works its magic and before we know it, we've found ourselves trapped under a pile of absurd artifacts, crippling debt and a mortgage to top it off. What the fuck happened? Ensnared by our own making. Emprisoned, even though we never wanted it. To willingly sacrifice one's own freedom... surely nobody in their right mind would do such thing. Yet we do.

It's a palpable sensation, this one of feeling trapped. And a cause of great anxiety, even for those perceptive enough to identify its roots. Especially because we know there is even more anxiety waiting behind the thoughts of devicing a way to escape. But freedom comes at a cost.

In order to break down the shackles, we must first have a good look and understand what these shackles are made of. Where is the anxiety coming from, exactly? And how much of this is real versus a matter of perception? Not only that, but if we are to be free, we must define what this even means for us, in the first place.

But I ain't here to give you any answers. You must find those yourself. That's part of the process. No one will come to our rescue. I certainly won't.

Sterling Hayden gives us a clue. An excerpt from his book _Wanderer_...

>What does a man need - really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in - and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment. That's all - in the material sense, and we know it. But we are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention for the sheer idiocy of the charade.

>The years thunder by, the dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed.

>Where, then, lies the answer? In choice. Which shall it be: bankruptcy of purse or bankruptcy of life?
